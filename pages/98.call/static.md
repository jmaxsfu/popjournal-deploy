## Imagining Open Infrastructures

Submissions due **May 1, 2020** via [info@popjournal.ca](mailto:info@popjournal.ca)

As we move into a new decade, the digital world is more commercialized than ever before. Software, hardware, social media – and more – are lucrative ventures for big corporate players. The academic world has not been spared from the creation and growth of firms who direct and control knowledge production—not just publishing in its traditional sense but through the broader infrastructure of scholarship. In response, "open infrastructure" has become a watchword in the broader academic world. There is a groundswell of concern and interest in the development, nurturing, and sustainability of open scholarly/scientific infrastructures that go beyond the provision of open access to research. Beyond access, it is critical to consider the multiple layers that support research creation, writing, publishing, circulation, and accreditation. But there is a critical opportunity to explore what is really meant by the term "open infrastructure" – and how it should be implemented.

For instance, in 2018 [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/)’s Heather Joseph called for “[Securing community-controlled infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.79.8.426),” in response to a legacy “[technological infrastructure that is rigid, cumbersome, and weighed down by interoperability challenges](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1215).” In 2019, the *Invest In Open* (IOI) initiative sought supports that can “[empower communities to collectively build the systems and infrastructures that deliver new improved collective benefits without restrictions](https://investinopen.org/docs/statement0.2.html),” while Code For Science & Society called for “[collaboration over competition in the ecosystem of open tools and projects](https://blog.codeforscience.org/invest-in-open-infrastructure/).” Even more broadly, David Lewis and colleagues called for academic libraries to “[invest 2.5% of its total budget to support the common infrastructure needed to create the open scholarly commons](https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.79.3.133).” What is even meant by a “scholarly commons” seems an invitation to interesting discussion. How do scholarly commons differ from other information environments?

What do we imagine when we imagine open infrastructures? What does this concept entail, in its vision, and in its drive to realization? This issue of *Pop!* is devoted to both imaginative and empirical investigations into what open infrastructures might be and might provide for us. We invite submissions – from scholars, librarians, developers, and anyone else who is interested in this topic – that explore the possibilities and help clarify and articulate the opportunities, challenges, upsides, and pitfalls of re-thinking the infrastructure of scholarly communications.

Topics might include:



*   Thinking beyond the traditional academic publishing system, journals, and books;
*   Who and what is excluded in the rhetoric of openness?
*   Decolonizing and/or Indigenizing infrastructures (e.g. [Indigitization](https://www.indigitization.ca), [Traditional Knowledge Labels and Licenses](https://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/))
*   [Open Knowledge Institutions](https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/oki); 
*   Issues of scale and scope;
*   Models for sustainability;
*   Collective action and its challenges;
*   Engaging new audiences, publics, fandoms;
*   New media scholarship: credentialing, distribution, impact;
*   New forms of scholarship;
*   Open infrastructures around the world.

*Pop!* invites contributions of 4000–5000 words, by email ([info@popjournal.ca](mailto:info@popjournal.ca)) by **May 1, 2020**. Please write us with any questions about this upcoming issue!

### About *Pop! Public. Open. Participatory.* 

*Pop!* ([https://popjournal.ca/](https://popjournal.ca/)) aims to be a ‘small-batch, handcrafted’ journal that puts its community first, that wants to be read, and that makes care a priority: care for its content, care for its audience, and care for the kind of world it wants to serve.

*Pop!* is rooted in the humanities, but spans a variety of disciplines and is purposefully structured to be open to varieties of intellectual engagement. Pop! includes editorials, conference proceedings, articles, book and event reviews, interviews, and research features. It showcases peer reviewed scholarly articles, but also an array of shorter updates on projects and people interesting to our community, as curated by Pop’s interdisciplinary editorial board (see [https://popjournal.ca/about](https://popjournal.ca/about)). *Pop!* is published at Simon Fraser University by the [Canadian Institute for Studies in Publishing](https://publishing.sfu.ca). 

*Pop!* is blind peer-reviewed by members of our scholarly community, who evaluate each article for its originality, coherence, scholarship, and for its readability, not just for specialist audiences within the university, but for broader interested audiences.
