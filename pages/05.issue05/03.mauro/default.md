abstract: 'As digital technology rapidly evolves, researchers in the Digital Humanities (DH) face the challenge of securing their work and protecting stakeholders across the research life cycle. Security practices, encompassing data integrity, software assurance, and authenticated access, must align with the values of openness, transparency, and collaboration that underpin scholarly research. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats, coupled with the politicization of research and the rise of autocratic governments, necessitates a holistic approach to security that considers both cyber and physical dimensions. This paper explores the intersection of security culture and DH research, emphasizing the importance of trust, informed consent, and ethical collaboration. It argues that security practices should be user-centric, participatory, and transparent, reflecting the values and goals of researchers and participants. By integrating security best practices into research methods, scholars can mitigate risks, protect research assets, and ensure the continued availability and impact of scholarship in a world where threats are constantly evolving.'
