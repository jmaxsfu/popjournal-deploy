     <jats:p>When it was founded in 2014, DARIAH-EU, the European digital research infrastructure for arts and humanities, recognized the importance of open science but did not place particular emphasis on it. In the time since, however, openness has come to rest at the heart of everything the infrastructure does. This piece will look at the process by which a research infrastructure comes to view itself as both a resource and champion for open science in their community, and how the contributions of such organizations can uniquely enhance openness in the arts and humanities.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>As digital technology rapidly evolves, researchers in the Digital Humanities (DH) face the challenge of securing their work and protecting stakeholders across the research life cycle. Security practices, encompassing data integrity, software assurance, and authenticated access, must align with the values of openness, transparency, and collaboration that underpin scholarly research. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats, coupled with the politicization of research and the rise of autocratic governments, necessitates a holistic approach to security that considers both cyber and physical dimensions. This paper explores the intersection of security culture and DH research, emphasizing the importance of trust, informed consent, and ethical collaboration. It argues that security practices should be user-centric, participatory, and transparent, reflecting the values and goals of researchers and participants. By integrating security best practices into research methods, scholars can mitigate risks, protect research assets, and ensure the continued availability and impact of scholarship in a world where threats are constantly evolving.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>In the first year since the launch of the HSS Commons, members have added over 100 publications and the features of the repository’s design are beginning to manifest. Building from Kim Martin’s talk on the possibilities for serendipity in browsing the Commons (Martin, 2022), I explore the descriptive metadata for this first cohort of publications, with particular focus on author-supplied keywords. Information studies predicts that author-supplied metadata enacts diverse sense of the intent and operation of fields, a tendency toward very high-level or general terminology, and the relevance of interaction design choices. This paper presents the metadata practices already visible in the HSS Commons and suggests interaction and maintenance design that can facilitate serendipitous discovery without compromising on the usability and creativity of the platform.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>The establishment of the Aldine Press in 1494 marked a pivotal moment in the history of printing and publishing in Western Europe. The range of technological and typographical innovations introduced by Renaissance educator-turned-publisher Aldus Manutius (ca. 1451–1515), as well as their lasting impact on our cultural history, has been extensively documented. However, a key aspect of Aldus’s larger cultural and intellectual mission remains understudied and merits further attention: the cultivation of a “rational-critical” literary public through the printing and wide circulation of high-quality editions of classical works. Drawing from critical reformulations of Habermas’s theory of “the public sphere” (specifically as revisited by Michael Warner), this paper seeks to investigate and understand how, and to what extent, Aldus’s expansive *pedagogical* and *civic* project contributed to the development of a proto-form of public discourse, in the modern sense, by leveraging the potential of the printing press to reach wider publics, beyond private familial and scholarly circles.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>As is well known, scientific publishing is a complex activity, and many constraints must be taken into account in order to address a range of issues, be they the structuration of the text, the inclusion of a critical apparatus, the sharing of texts during the revision and editing phases, and the dissemination of the final version via multiple platforms. Existing publishing chains allow for the management of texts, their production, editing and publication; they are systems that take these parameters into account by default. However, they remain dependent on specific software that is generally not well adapted to scientific publishing, or on technical infrastructures that are difficult to maintain and to use by SSH researchers, or that do not allow for experimentation and necessary rethinking on new editorial and epistemological models. What if, by modifying the publishing chains from more singular technical approaches, it is possible to consider new publishing practices? It is about rethinking the way books are edited and published through the editing of books in a university publisher series ("Parcours numériques" at the Presse de l’Université de Montréal). Several principles are adopted to reconfigure the publishing chain: multimodal publishing, modular factory, minimal computing and progressive enhancement. Furthermore, it is about what was adapted for a new publishing experiment (Les Ateliers de [sens public]) along the way.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>This paper examines the possibilities for moving a print journal to Diamond Open Access electronic publication. It uses a case study of a mature academic publication, the John Donne Journal, to explore options for a transition that retains a print version of the journal—and thus its institutional and individual subscribers—while at the same time establishing a fully Open Access electronic version. Informed by a survey-based assessment of the interests and values of the membership of the John Donne Society (the journal's issuing body) and by a brief survey of the state of Open Access journal publication in Renaissance Studies, this paper then examines the means by which other journals have achieved electronic publication and the remaining options for sustainable (i.e. funded) Open Access journal publication. It ends by proposing an independent ('hipster') model for the John Donne Journal that leverages the print form as an asset and basis for approaching subscribing libraries to join the journal as continuing subscribers and partners in Open Access publication.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>“Media Art on Wikipedia” is a collaborative project launched by Amsterdam-based platform for media art LIMA (Living Media Art), conducted in partnership with national and international art collections, national universities, and Wikimedia Nederland. Involving coordination of edit-a-thons and ingest of collection metadata within the structure of Wikidata, the project aims to bridge and mobilize the domain knowledge of media art beyond the institutional silo through engagement with the ethos, procedures and affordances of the Wikimedia ecosystem. This article profiles and situates this attempt within the particular institutional context of media art and the broader turn towards open, participatory, and distributed configuration of public institutions. Comparing infrastructural topologies identified within the discourse of media art by mapping them to tensions between centralized and distributed approaches, this article positions the project as a composite of models blurring their unambiguous theoretical distinction. This analysis serves to investigate ways in which the project responds to the conditions underlying the field’s modes of knowledge production—on one hand the demand for the reimagining of methods of documentation, preservation, and historicization stemming from the specificity of media art; and the systemic precarity of media art’s knowledge infrastructures on the other.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>This essay explores the results of a dissertation research project on the effective communication and rhetorical practices of sommeliers and wine professionals. Through rhetorical analysis of this industry’s discourse, frameworks for teaching communication in the Humanities have been reenvisioned in light of recent cultural revolutions. Potential methods for recomposing teaching and learning structures are discussed to illuminate more opportunities for reflection on the rhetorical situation and enjoyment of the process of developing ourselves as communicators. The overarching goal of this research is to show how Humanities researchers can use the affordances of cross-disciplinary education to revitalize learning about traditional concepts by pairing unconventional and sometimes contrasting perspectives together to reveal new ways of thinking.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>Knowledge and its production is informed by the availability of and access to existing knowledge infrastructures. Historically, both the production of knowledge and knowledge infrastructures have been dominated and dictated by western1 schools of thoughts that elided, erased, neglected, and negated the existence of multiple epistemologies. This paper explores ways to understand the depth and breadth of global colonial legacies and epistemic coloniality—and locate the pathways out in the archives. Using South Asian Canadian Digital Archive (https://sacda.ca) as a case study, the paper questions ways to rethink, redefine, and refine the methodologies of traditional archives to enable spaces for open and inclusive scholarship. It further frames SACDA (1897 to present) as an open tool for building multilingual knowledge infrastructures and to bring the larger community into the process of collective knowledge mobilization, creation, and dissemination.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>Inspired by the way that hands-on science centres playfully introduce children and adults alike to the curiosities and complexities of our biological, chemical, and physical world, the *Virtual Realizations, Playable Archives* project, emerging from the INKE SSHRC partnership’s *Community* cluster, is exploring strategies to interactively engage broader publics with the wonders and challenges of humanities knowledge, research, and research communication. This paper’s focus on *Chowdr*, one prototype example from the *Virtual Realizations* project, is intended to initiate larger critical conversations about play, community, and open social scholarship values by using a food-based social networking app. This prototype is designed to create meaningful engagement among users by having them share their personal recipes for seafood chowder, and in doing so, playfully connect with their community and their food culture.</jats:p>

     <jats:p>Open social scholarship implies a community of academic specialists and non-specialists working together to create, disseminate, and use research to ensure that it is engaged in broader contexts than initially envisioned.  But what are the best ways to do this?  The Implementing New Knowledge Environment (INKE) project on open social scholarship is working to answer this question with a collaborative team of academic and academic-adjacent researchers and partners.  But this raises questions in its own right – how can researchers and partners, with differing organizational cultures, objectives and goals, and expertise, work together to further open social scholarship?  Continuing research on collaboration from the first INKE project on electronic books and reading, this paper examines the nature of collaboration with INKE’s new focus on open social scholarship.  Through yearly interviews of team members, it explores the nature of collaboration, its advantages and disadvantages, and measures of success.  This paper will explore the collaboration’s first year of research.  It will also include some reflection on collaboration in the age of COVID.</jats:p>
