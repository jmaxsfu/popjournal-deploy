abstract: 'When it was founded in 2014, DARIAH-EU, the European digital research infrastructure for arts and humanities, recognized the importance of open science but did not place particular emphasis on it. In the time since, however, openness has come to rest at the heart of everything the infrastructure does. This piece will look at the process by which a research infrastructure comes to view itself as both a resource and champion for open science in their community, and how the contributions of such organizations can uniquely enhance openness in the arts and humanities.'
