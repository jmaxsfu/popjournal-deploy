abstract: 'The establishment of the Aldine Press in 1494 marked a pivotal moment in the history of printing and publishing in Western Europe. The range of technological and typographical innovations introduced by Renaissance educator-turned-publisher Aldus Manutius (ca. 1451–1515), as well as their lasting impact on our cultural history, has been extensively documented. However, a key aspect of Aldus’s larger cultural and intellectual mission remains understudied and merits further attention: the cultivation of a “rational-critical” literary public through the printing and wide circulation of high-quality editions of classical works. Drawing from critical reformulations of Habermas’s theory of “the public sphere” (specifically as revisited by Michael Warner), this paper seeks to investigate and understand how, and to what extent, Aldus’s expansive *pedagogical* and *civic* project contributed to the development of a proto-form of public discourse, in the modern sense, by leveraging the potential of the printing press to reach wider publics, beyond private familial and scholarly circles.'
