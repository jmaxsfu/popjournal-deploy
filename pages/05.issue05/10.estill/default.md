abstract: 'This short article traces the development and initial three years of DHSI-East (the Digital Humanities Summer Institute–East), a digital humanities training workshop based in Atlantic Canada. This article points to the importance of regional training that is situated in larger contexts, while recognizing the labour and time of those who make these workshops possible: organizers, instructors, speakers, and participants. Reflecting on past events and considering future possibilities, in this piece, I consider the challenges and benefits of regional digital humanities training in Atlantic Canada.'
