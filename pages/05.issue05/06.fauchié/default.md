  bio: 'After a PhD in English literature at Oxford during which he founded the open access electronic journal "Romanticism on the Net" in February 1996, Michael E. Sinatra has been a full professor at the Université de Montréal since 2001. He is the founding director of the Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques since Fall 2013, based at the Université de Montréal with institutional partners Concordia University and McGill University. He is also the P.I of the FRQSC-funded "Groupe de Recherche sur les Éditions critiques en contexte Numérique", and co-director, with Marcello Vitali Rosati, of the series "Parcours numériques" at the Presses de l'Université de Montréal.'

  bio: 'Marcello Vitali-Rosati is Full Professor in the Department of French Literature at the University of Montréal and chairholder for the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities. His research offers a philosophical reflection on digital technologies and the issues pertaining to them, including concepts relating to the virtual, to digital identity, to the author and authorship, to forms of production as well as to the dissemination and legitimization of knowledge in the digital age. In addition, he is one of the most active contributors of the theory of editorialization. He is the author of several articles and monographs. He is also editor in chief of the journal Sens Public and co-director of the “Parcours Numériques" collection at the Presses de l’Université de Montréal (PUM). As chairholder of the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities, he also directs several digital humanities projects, particularly as pertains to the scholarly publishing field. Within this framework, he directs the development of journal editing and augmented monograph platforms, editing software and an editing platform for the collaborative edition of the Greek Anthology.'
abstract: 'As is well known, scientific publishing is a complex activity, and many constraints must be taken into account in order to address a range of issues, be they the structuration of the text, the inclusion of a critical apparatus, the sharing of texts during the revision and editing phases, and the dissemination of the final version via multiple platforms. Existing publishing chains allow for the management of texts, their production, editing and publication; they are systems that take these parameters into account by default. However, they remain dependent on specific software that is generally not well adapted to scientific publishing, or on technical infrastructures that are difficult to maintain and to use by SSH researchers, or that do not allow for experimentation and necessary rethinking on new editorial and epistemological models. What if, by modifying the publishing chains from more singular technical approaches, it is possible to consider new publishing practices? It is about rethinking the way books are edited and published through the editing of books in a university publisher series ("Parcours numériques" at the Presse de l'Université de Montréal). Several principles are adopted to reconfigure the publishing chain: multimodal publishing, modular factory, minimal computing and progressive enhancement. Furthermore, it is about what was adapted for a new publishing experiment (Les Ateliers de [sens public]) along the way.'
